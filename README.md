# Description 
This project loads the video of the road then subtracts the backround to get the moving foreground objects and classify each object to know whether it is a vehicle or not.

# Model Training (SVM model)

1. Load the dataset and put them into two numpy arrays(one for vehicles and one for non vehcles), vehicles images used :https://s3.amazonaws.com/udacity-sdc/Vehicle_Tracking/vehicles.zip , non-vehicles images: https://s3.amazonaws.com/udacity-sdc/Vehicle_Tracking/non-vehicles.zip 
2. We splitted the data into training and testing sets.

3. We wanted to avoid our model from getting overfit so we augmented the training-set by flipping, rescaling and changing the brightness of the images.
4. For feature extraction we used the Histogram of gradients HOG and SIFT as features and then flattened them and concatenated them into one feature vector for each image
5. We fed the SVM model the feature vectors of the images and crossed our fingers it will learn well.
6. That's the Classification report:
